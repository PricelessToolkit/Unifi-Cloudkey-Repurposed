## 🎯 Goals

- Extend hardware lifespan
- Keep setup minimal and practical
- Avoid unnecessary complexity
- Repurpose instead of discard

## Getting Started

Before applying the modifications in this repository, make sure the Cloud Key is updated to the latest firmware.

SSH access must be enabled from the UniFi OS web interface.  
When enabling SSH from the UI, you set the root password there.

Default SSH user:

- `root`

Login example:

```bash
ssh root@<cloudkey-ip>
```

Before proceeding, uninstall any unused UniFi applications from the UI, such as:

- UniFi Network
- UniFi Protect
- Any other UniFi services

This device is being repurposed and should not run unnecessary controller services.

⚠ **Very important:** Disable automatic updates in UniFi OS settings.  
Automatic updates may reinstall services or overwrite custom configurations.

After logging in and cleaning the system, follow the instructions in this repository to convert the device into a minimal remote backup / NAS node.

Use the documentation files provided:

- `motd.md` – Custom login banner configuration  
- `log.md` – RAM-only journald configuration  
- `smb.md` – Samba (SMB) setup for `/volume1/backup`  
- `wireguard.md` – WireGuard client configuration  
- `Led and Battery.md` – LED control and battery monitoring  
- `rsync-snapshots.md` – Snapshot backup script and usage instructions
